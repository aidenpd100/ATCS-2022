                Hi, my name is Aiden Deffner and I am a senior student-athelete at Menlo School in Atherton, California. 
                I started running my freshman year, and since then, I have had an incredible experience 
                with cross country and track throughout all four years of high school! I love hanging out with my team and working
                hard year-round to improve my times. In my free time, I enjoy
                running (obviously), hanging out with friends/family, and playing with my dog.
            </p>
